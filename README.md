This directory contains handy scripts and tools that I've written over the
years.

*	*osd.sh* This is a quick and dirty script written using aosd to print
	some text to the screen.  I use it for messaging me when meso sized
	jobs finish (I don't want to stare at a terminal for 2 minutes, but
	I can't go for a walk in that time).
